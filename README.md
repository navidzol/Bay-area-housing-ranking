# Bay Area ZIP Code Map Visualization

## Overview
This is a self-hosted web application that displays a map of the Bay Area, divided by ZIP codes and color-coded based on various criteria that influence home-buying decisions. Users can select and adjust different factors, such as school district rankings and niche rankings, to visualize how each ZIP code compares. The map dynamically updates based on the selected criteria, and users can click on a ZIP code to view detailed information.

## Features
- **Interactive Map**: Displays the Bay Area with ZIP code boundaries.
- **Dynamic Color Coding**: Colors ZIP code regions based on weighted rankings, with high values in blue and low values in red.
- **Customizable Criteria**: Users can add or remove factors like school rankings, niche rankings, and other home-buying indicators.
- **Detailed ZIP Code Data**: Clicking on a ZIP code reveals its ranking details and additional relevant information.
- **Self-Hosted**: Designed for easy deployment on personal servers.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Leaflet.js for map rendering)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express) for serving data
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite for storing ranking data
- **Docker (Optional)**: For easy deployment

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment)
- A web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, or a built-in Flask/Django server)
- A database (PostgreSQL recommended, but SQLite can be used for smaller setups)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bay-area-map.git
   cd bay-area-map
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install  # For frontend dependencies (if using a JavaScript framework)
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If using Python backend
   ```
3. **Run the server**:
   ```sh
   python app.py  # If using Flask
   ```
   OR
   ```sh
   npm start  # If using a Node.js backend
   ```
4. **Access the application**: Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured port).

## Usage
1. Select or modify ranking criteria.
2. View the color-coded ZIP code map.
3. Click on a ZIP code for detailed ranking information.
4. Adjust criteria to see real-time changes in the map.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more home-buying factors (e.g., crime rate, property taxes, commute time).
- Improve UI with better charts and visualization tools.
- Support additional regions beyond the Bay Area.
- Implement user authentication for saving preferences.
